# Products

## About
The repo contains scrapers that fetch product information from popular brands. It's a non-commercial sandbox to practice web scraping.

## Process
The data are collected from each brand's website with Python and Jupyter Lab notebooks stored in the `notebooks/brand_scrapers` directory.
